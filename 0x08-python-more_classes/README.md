#WHAT I LEARNED

You can define classes and objects in Python to represent abstract ideas or real-world items.

#Classes:
A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that the objects will have. Classes are like a blueprint for creating objects. You define a class using the class keyword.

#Objects:
An object is an instance of a class. You can create multiple objects (instances) from the same class, each with its own unique attribute values. To create an object, you simply call the class as if it were a function.

#Accessing Object Attributes and Methods:
You can access an object's attributes and methods using the dot notation.

#Constructors:
The __init__ method is a special method called the constructor. It is automatically called when an object is created from the class and initializes its attributes.

#Class vs. Instance Variables:
Class variables are shared by all instances of a class. You define them outside of any method in the class.
Instance variables are specific to each object. You define them inside the __init__ method.
