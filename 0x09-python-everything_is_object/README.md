# Python - Everything is object


It aims to learn about object oriented programming (OOP), mutability, identity and data types in **Python**.

## What I Learned
In Python, the concept that "everything is an object" is a fundamental principle. This means that all data types and entities in Python are represented as objects.
Here are some common parameters related to this concept:

Object: In Python, an object is a self-contained unit that encapsulates both data and the functions that operate on the data.

Data Types: In Python, data types such as integers, strings, lists, and dictionaries are all objects. They have attributes and methods associated with them.

Attributes: Objects can have attributes, which are data associated with the object. For example, a string object has attributes like length.

Methods: Objects have methods, which are functions associated with the object that can perform operations on the object's data. For example, string objects have methods like upper() and lower().

Classes: Classes are blueprints for creating objects. When you create an instance of a class, you are creating an object.

Instance: An instance is a specific object created from a class. Each instance of a class has its own set of attributes and can invoke methods.

Reference: Variables in Python are references to objects. When you create a variable and assign an object to it, you're creating a reference to that object.

Object Identity: Every object in Python has a unique identity, which can be checked using the id() function.

The "everything is an object" philosophy in Python makes it a highly flexible and dynamic programming language, allowing you to work with various data types and create custom objects with ease. It also means that you can manipulate and inspect objects in a consistent and object-oriented manner.
