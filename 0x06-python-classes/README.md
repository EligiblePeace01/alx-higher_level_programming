Python - Classes and Objects


#THINGS I LEARNED:
In Python, classes and objects are fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP). They allow you to model and organize your code in a way that represents real-world entities and their behavior.


#Here's a basic introduction to classes and objects in Python:

Classes:

A class is like a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects of the class will have. You can think of a class as a template for creating objects.


Objects:

Objects are instances of a class, created based on the class's blueprint. You can create multiple objects from a single class.

Accessing Attributes and Methods:

You can access the attributes and methods of objects using the dot notation.


Class Variables:

Class variables are shared by all instances of a class. They are defined within the class but outside of any methods. Class variables are accessed using the class name or an instance of the class.

Classes and objects are a powerful way to organize and structure your code, making it more modular and maintainable. You may develop complicated applications by defining many classes, each with its own properties and functions, and then generating objects from these classes to interact with one another.
