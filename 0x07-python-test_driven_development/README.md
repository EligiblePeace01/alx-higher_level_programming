#0x07. Python - Test-driven development

Welcome to the Python Test-driven Development (TDD) project! This repository is designed to help you learn and practice Test-driven Development (TDD) in Python.




Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development methodology in which you write tests for your code before you actually write the code itself. Python is a popular language for practicing TDD because it has a robust testing framework called unittest, as well as third-party libraries like pytest and nose that make writing and running tests easier. 

By following TDD, you ensure that your code is thoroughly tested, and you can be more confident that it works as expected. It also helps in defining the requirements and expected behavior of your code before you even start implementing it. This can lead to cleaner and more maintainable code.

#Here's a detailed guide on using TDD in Python:

Write a Test: Start by writing a test that defines the behavior you want your code to exhibit. Tests in Python are usually written using a testing framework. Let's say you're developing a simple function to add two numbers.


Run the Test: When you run this test, it will fail because the add_numbers function does not exist yet. This is the red phase in TDD, indicating that the test has failed.

Write the Code: Now, you write the add_numbers function to make the test pass. Keep your code as simple as possible to make the test pass.

Run the Test Again: After writing the code, run the test again. It should pass this time. This is the green phase in TDD, indicating that the test has succeeded.

Refactor (if necessary): Once the test passes, you can refactor your code to improve its structure or performance while ensuring that the tests continue to pass. This is the refactor phase.

Repeat: You can now repeat the process for other parts of your codebase, adding new tests and code iteratively.
