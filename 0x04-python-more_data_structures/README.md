0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary


In this directory, I learned about sets, dictionaries, and functions to handle data structures like lambda, map, reduce, and filter in Python.



Sets:


Introduction to sets as an unordered grouping of distinctive components.
Using curly braces or the set() constructor to create sets.
Using operators and techniques to do standard set operations including union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.
utilizing methods like add(), delete(), discard(), and clear() to modify sets.
checking the set's equality and membership.



Dictionaries:

A description of dictionaries as a collection of key-value pairs that is not ordered.
utilizing curly braces or the dict() constructor to create dictionaries.
employing keyboard shortcuts to access, add to, edit, and delete dictionary components.
using methods like keys(), values(), and items() to iterate across dictionaries.
membership and the presence of keys are being verified.
creating dictionaries from iterable objects using dictionary comprehensions.
In Python, these data structures are crucial for a number of tasks, including handling data collections.
